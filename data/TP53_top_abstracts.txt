Abstract: CD8+ T cells play basic roles in the immune system in a tumor microenvironment (TME) to fight cancer. Several reports have suggested signs of the involvement of tumor protein p53 (TP53) in a complex immune system network. Moreover, our previous research indicated that TP53 orchestrates the polarization and infiltration of macrophages into the TME. In the present study, the clinical function of TP53 status (wild/mutant) in CD8+ T cell infiltration was assessed using more than 10,000 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples from 30 cancer types through Tumor Immune Estimation (TIMER). Our investigation revealed that CD8+ T cell infiltration was higher in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) patients with wild-type TP53 than in those with mutant TP53. Wild-type TP53 conferred a good prognosis for HNSC and UCEC (P<0.05). In contrast, CD8+ T cell infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with wild-type TP53 was much lower than in those with mutant TP53. Notably, clinical outcomes for LUAD with wild-type TP53 were poor (P<0.05). This study was the first to provide insights into the novel association of TP53 with CD8+ T cells infiltration in the TME in patients with HNSC, LUAD, and UCEC. Therefore, TP53 status acts as a prognostic marker, and this can be used as a basis to further study the effect of targeting TP53 in these patients. Furthermore, our study found that TP53 status was a reliable predictive factor and therapeutic target in patients with HNSC and UCEC.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a multifactorial genetic disorder caused by interactive effects of environmental and genetic factors. The proper locus of the TP53 gene (17p13.1) and its protein is essential in genomic stability. The most common variant of the TP53 gene-p.P72R (rs1042522)-shows functional variation. The aim of our study was a complex analysis of the TP53 p.P72R variant and TP53 gene expression in relation to chromosomal changes of the TP53 gene locus, as well as MM risk and outcome. Genomic DNA from 129 newly diagnosed MM patients was analyzed by methods of automated DNA sequencing (for TP53 variant analysis) and cIg-FISH (for chromosomal aberrations analysis). RNA was used in real-time PCR to determine the TP53 expression. In MM patients, the TP53 variant was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The RR genotype was associated with lower MM risk (OR = 0.44, p = 0.004). A higher number of plasma cells was found in patients with RR genotype in comparison to those with PP + PR genotypes (36.74% vs. 28.30%, p = 0.02). A higher expression of the TP53 gene was observed in PP + PR genotypes vs. RR homozygote (p < 0.001), in smokers vs. non-smokers (p = 0.02). A positive Pearson's correlation was found between the TP53 expression level and the number of plasma cells (r = 0.26, p = 0.04). The presence of chromosome 17 aberrations with or without TP53 locus did not affect the MM risk and outcome. Similar results were observed in the case of TP53 gene expression and the p.P72R variant.

Abstract: TP53 mutation (TP53mut) occurs in 10-20% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases and serves as an unfavorable biomarker of DLBCL progression. It confers resistance to immunochemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, and anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Therapeutic targeting of TP53mut remains a significant challenge in DLBCL treatment. Here we assessed TP53mut in 667 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, including 576 patients treated with immunochemotherapy rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) and 91 patients with decitabine plus R-CHOP (DR-CHOP, NCT02951728 and NCT04025593). TP53mut independently predicted an inferior prognosis in R-CHOP-treated DLBCL, although this could be mitigated by DR-CHOP treatment. In TP53mut patients, multiple viral regulation pathways were repressed, resulting in the inhibition of immune modulation, as revealed by gene set enrichment analysis. TP53mut DLBCL exhibited increased methyltransferase SUV39H1 expression and H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), contributing to repression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In TP53mut DLBCL cell lines, decitabine down-regulated SUV39H1, inhibited H3K9me3 occupancy on ERVs, and triggered ERV expression, thereby unleashing interferons program and CD4+T/CD8+T cell activation. Molecular silencing of SUV39H1 significantly abrogated decitabine-induced H3K9me3 inhibition and ERV expression. In TP53mut patient-derived xenograft models and TP53mut patients, the anti-tumor effect was improved upon the use of combined treatment of decitabine and doxorubicin via SUV39H1-H3K9me3-ERVs axis. Collectively, our findings highlight an ERV regulatory circuitry in TP53mut DLBCL and the crucial roles ERVs for epigenetically reprogramming tumor microenvironment for treating TP53mut-driven cancers.

Abstract: TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers and was the first tumor suppressor gene to be discovered in the history of medical science. Mutations in the TP53 gene occur at various genetic locations and exhibit significant heterogeneity among patients. Mutations occurring primarily within the DNA-binding domain of TP53 result in the loss of the p53 protein's DNA-binding capability. However, a complex phenotypic landscape often combines gain-of-function, dominant negative, or altered specificity features. This complexity poses a significant challenge in developing an effective treatment strategy, which eradicates TP53-mutated cancer clones. This review summarizes the current understanding of TP53 mutations in AML and their implications. TP53 mutation in AML: In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), six hotspot mutations (R175H, G245S, R248Q/W, R249S, R273H/S, and R282W) within the DNA-binding domain are common. TP53 mutations are frequently associated with a complex karyotype and subgroups of therapy-related or secondary AML. The presence of TP53 mutation is considered as a poor prognostic factor. TP53-mutated AML is even classified as a distinct subgroup of AML by itself, as TP53-mutated AML exhibits a significantly distinct landscape in terms of co-mutation and gene expression profiles compared with wildtype (WT)-TP53 AML.

Abstract: KRAS-TP53 co-mutation is strongly associated with poor prognosis and high malignancy in gastrointestinal cancers. Therefore, a novel approach to oncotherapy may lie in combination therapy targeting both KRAS and TP53. Herein, we present a novel self-assembled nanoparticle (HA-TPP/A) that are functionalized nano-carrier hyaluronic acid (HA)-TPP conjugate (HA-TPP) to degrade mutant p53 proteins (mutp53) and co-deliver AMG510 for treating KRAS-TP53 co-alteration of gastrointestinal cancers by inhibiting the mutant KRAS and mutp53 signaling pathways. The HA-TPP/A nanoparticles led to ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation of mutp53 by targeting damage to mitochondria. Furthermore, these nanoparticles abrogated the gain-of-function (GOF) phenotypes of mutp53 and increased sensitivity to AMG510-induced cell killing, thereby reducing cell proliferation and migration in gastrointestinal cancer with KRAS-TP53 co-mutation. The co-loaded HA-TPP/A nanoparticles demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy in a tumor-bearing mouse model, particularly in KRAS-TP53 double mutant expressing cancer cells, compared with single drug and combined free drug groups. Notably, HA-TPP/A is the first reported nanoparticle with an ability to co-target KRAS-TP53, providing a promising approach for therapy in highly malignant gastrointestinal tumors and potentially expanding clinical indications for AMG510 targeted therapies in gastrointestinal tumors.

Abstract:  The development of targeted therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1), has improved patients' prognosis and significantly extended progression-free survival. However, it remains unclear why some patients do not benefit from the treatment as much or have a rapid disease progression. It is considered that, apart from the oncogenic driver gene, molecular alterations in a number of caretaker and gatekeeper genes significantly impact the efficacy of targeted therapies.The tumor protein 53 (TP53) gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in NSCLC. To date, numerous studies have investigated the influence of various TP53 alterations on patient prognosis and responsiveness to therapies targeting EGFR, ALK, or ROS1. This review focuses on the latest data concerning the role of TP53 alterations as prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced NSCLC patients. Since the presence of TP53 mutations in NSCLC has been linked to its decreased responsiveness to EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 targeted therapy in most of the referenced studies, the review also discusses the impact of TP53 mutations on treatment resistance.It seems plausible that assessing the TP53 mutation status could aid in patient stratification for optimal clinical decision-making. However, drawing meaningful conclusions about the clinical value of the TP53 co-mutations in EGFR-, ALK- or ROS1-positive NSCLC is hampered mainly by an insufficient knowledge regarding the functional consequences of the TP53 alterations. The integration of next-generation sequencing into the routine molecular diagnostics of cancer patients will facilitate the detection and identification of targetable genetic alterations along with co-occurring TP53 variants. This advancement holds the potential to accelerate understanding of the biological and clinical role of p53 in targeted therapies for NSCLC.

Abstract: Previous studies in patients with mature B-cell lymphomas (MBCL) have shown that pathogenic TP53 aberrations are associated with inferior chemotherapeutic efficacy and survival outcomes. In solid malignancies, p53 immunohistochemistry is commonly used as a surrogate marker to assess TP53 mutations, but this correlation is not yet well-established in lymphomas. This study evaluated the accuracy of p53 immunohistochemistry as a surrogate marker for TP53 mutational analysis in a large real-world patient cohort of 354 MBCL patients within routine diagnostic practice. For each case, p53 IHC was assigned to one of three categories: wild type (staining 1-50% of tumor cells with variable nuclear staining), abnormal complete absence or abnormal overexpression (strong and diffuse staining > 50% of tumor cells). Pathogenic variants of TP53 were identified with a targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS) panel. Wild type p53 expression was observed in 267 cases (75.4%), complete absence in twenty cases (5.7%) and the overexpression pattern in 67 cases (18.9%). tNGS identified a pathogenic TP53 mutation in 102 patients (29%). The overall accuracy of p53 IHC was 84.5% (95% CI 80.3-88.1), with a robust specificity of 92.1% (95% CI 88.0- 95.1), but a low sensitivity of 65.7% (95% CI 55.7-74.8). These results suggest that the performance of p53 IHC is insufficient as a surrogate marker for TP53 mutations in our real-world routine diagnostic workup of MBCL patients. By using p53 immunohistochemistry alone, there is a significant risk a TP53 mutation will be missed, resulting in misevaluation of a high-risk patient. Therefore, molecular analysis is recommended in all MBCL patients, especially for further development of risk-directed therapies based on TP53 mutation status.

Abstract: Contemporary risk models in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) include the mutation (MIPSS70) and mutation/karyotype enhanced (MIPSS70 plus/v2.0) international prognostic scoring systems. High molecular risk (HMR) mutations incorporated in one or both of these models include ASXL1, SRSF2, EZH2, IDH1/2, and U2AF1Q157; the current study examines additional prognostic contribution from more recently described HMR mutations, including CBL, NRAS, KRAS, RUNX1, and TP53. In a cohort of 363 informative cases (median age 58 years; 60% males), mutations included JAK2 61%, CALR 24%, MPL 6%, ASXL1 29%, SRSF2 10%, U2AF1Q157 5%, EZH2 10%, IDH1/2 4%, TP53 5%, CBL 5%, NRAS 7%, KRAS 4%, and RUNX1 4%. At a median follow-up of 4.6 years, 135 (37%) deaths and 42 (11.6%) leukemic transformations were recorded. Univariate analysis confirmed significant survival impact from the original MIPSS70/plus/v2.0 HMR mutations as well as CBL (HR 2.8; p < .001), NRAS (HR 2.4; p < .001), KRAS (HR 2.1; p = .01), and TP53 (HR 2.4; p = .004), but not RUNX1 mutations (HR 1.8; p = .08). Multivariate analysis (MVA) that included both the original and more recently described HMR mutations confirmed independent prognostic contribution from ASXL1 (HR 1.8; p = .007), SRSF2 (HR 4.3; p < .001), U2AF1Q157 (HR 2.9, p = .004), and EZH2 (HR 2.4; p < .001), but not from IDH1/2 (p = .3), TP53 (p = .2), CBL (p = .3), NRAS (p = .8) or KRAS (p = .2) mutations. The lack of additional prognostic value from CBL, NRAS, KRAS, RUNX1, and TP53 was further demonstrated in the setting of (i) MVA of mutations and karyotype, (ii) MVA of MIPSS70/plus/v2.0 composite scores and each one of the recently described HMR mutations, except TP53, and iii) modified MIPSS70/plus/plus v2.0 that included CBL, NRAS, KRAS, and TP53 as part of the HMR constituency, operationally referred to as "HMR+" category. Furthermore, "HMR+" enhancement of MIPSS70/plus/plus v2.0 did not result in improved model performance, as measured by C-statistics. We conclude that prognostic integrity of MIPSS70/plus/plus v2.0, as well as their genetic components, was sustained and their value not significantly upgraded by the inclusion of more recently described HMR mutations, including CBL, NRAS, KRAS, and RUNX1. Additional studies are needed to clarify the apparent additional prognostic value of TP53 mutation and its allelic state.

Abstract: Defects in ribosomal biogenesis profoundly affect organismal development and cellular function, and these ribosomopathies produce a variety of phenotypes. One ribosomopathy, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is characterized by neutropenia, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and skeletal anomalies. SDS results from biallelic mutations in SBDS, which encodes a ribosome assembly factor. Some individuals express a missense mutation, SBDS R126T , along with the common K62X mutation. We reported that the sbds-null zebrafish phenocopies much of SDS. We further showed activation of Tp53-dependent pathways before the fish died during the larval stage. Here, we expressed SBDS R126T as a transgene in the sbds -/- background. We showed that one copy of the SBDS R126T transgene permitted the establishment of maternal zygotic sbds-null fish which produced defective embryos with cdkn1a up-regulation, a Tp53 target involved in cell cycle arrest. None survived beyond 3 dpf. However, two copies of the transgene resulted in normal development and lifespan. Surprisingly, neutropenia persisted. The surviving fish displayed suppression of female sex differentiation, a stress response in zebrafish. To evaluate the role of Tp53 in the pathogenesis of sbds -/- fish phenotype, we bred the fish with a DNA binding deficient allele, tp53 M214K Expression of the loss-of-function tp53 M214K did not rescue neutropenia or survival in sbds-null zebrafish. Increased expression of cdkn1a was abrogated in the tp53 M214K/M214K ;sbds -/- fish. We conclude that the amount of SBDSR126T protein is important for development, inactivation of Tp53 fails to rescue neutropenia or survival in the sbds-null background, and cdkn1a up-regulation was dependent on WT tp53 We hypothesize that additional pathways are involved in the pathophysiology of SDS.

Abstract: Pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline TP53 variants are the primary cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a hereditary cancer predisposition disorder characterized by early-onset cancers. The population prevalence of P/LP germline TP53 variants is estimated to be approximately one in every 3,500-20,000 individuals. However, these estimates are likely impacted by ascertainment biases and lack of clinical and genetic data to account for potential confounding factors, such as clonal hematopoiesis. Genome-first approaches of cohorts linked to phenotype data can further refine these estimates by identifying individuals with variants of interest and then assessing their phenotypes. This study evaluated P/LP germline (variant allele fraction ≥ 30%) TP53 variants in three cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=200,590), Geisinger (n=170,503), and Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB, n=43,731). A total of 109 individuals were identified with P/LP germline TP53 variants across the three databases. The TP53 p.R181H variant was the most frequently identified (9/109 individuals, 8%). A total of 110 cancers, including 47 hematologic cancers (47/110, 43%), were reported in 71 individuals. The prevalence of P/LP germline TP53 variants were conservatively estimated as 1:10,439 in UKB, 1:3,790 in Geisinger, and 1:2,983 in PMBB after removing related individuals and heterozygotes who had ever developed a hematologic cancer due to the potential confounding impact of clonal hematopoiesis. These varying estimates likely reflect intrinsic selection biases of each database, such as healthcare or population-based contexts. Prospective studies of diverse, young cohorts are required to better understand population prevalence of germline TP53 variants and its associated cancer penetrance.
